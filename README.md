This is a project done as a part of the Odin Project.

Objective is to ensure that when the corresponding key is pressed, a sound is made. 
The box should also change in dimensions.

Time: <strong> 94 mins to complete. </strong>

My thought/working process: <br>

1. Console log the event (e) for the key press
- Did this with ```if statements``` for testing
- Realised that ```if``` statemnets are too repetitive so should do document.querySelector
- Learned about ES6 JS backticks = called Template Strings
- Got the audio to play

<br>

2. Add the CSS transition 
- Use of ```ClassList``` to add to div.

<br>

3. Remove the CSS playing class
- Newfunction called ```function removeTransition(e)```
- Properly used arrow function ```=>``` for the first time. Much easier
- Looked further into the ```propertyName```
- use ```ClassList``` again to remove playing if a ```transition``` propertyName

<br>

4. Finished.
<br>

<strong> Sound only comes out for the G arrowdown because I still need to learn/figure out how to git clone repos properly </strong>
