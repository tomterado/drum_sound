This is a project done as a part of the Odin Project.

Objective is to ensure that when the corresponding key is pressed, a sound is made. 
The box should also change in dimensions.

My thought process: <br>

** 1. Console log the event (e) for the key press **

<ul> Did this with if statements for testing</ul>
<ul> Realised that if statemnets are too repetitive so should do document.querySelectorAll</ul>


2. Associate it to the sound
3.
